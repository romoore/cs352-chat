Compiling the client:
  The chat client has been written according to Java 1.6.  If you do not have
  Java 1.6 installed, please download and install the JDK from Oracle at
  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html>.

  To compile the chat client, include the "src" directory in the class path and
  provide edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient as the main class to be 
  compiled:

    javac -cp src/ src/edu/rutgers/cs/chat/ChatClient.java

Running the client:
  The chat client requires 2 command-line parameters: local listen port and 
  username.  These are the first two parameters to the client.  Optionally,
  a remote client may be specified as a bootstrap client.  The additional
  two parameters are the remote host/IP address and port number.

  To start the client with "foo" as the username, listening on port 12345:
    java -cp src/ edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient 12345 foo

  To start the client with "foo" as the username, 12345 as the listen port,
  and 1.2.3.4:9999 as the bootstrap peer:
    java -cp src/ edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient 12345 foo 1.2.3.4 9999

Interacting with the console-based user interface:
  The current version of the chat client comes with a console user interface.
  Once connected to a remote peer, the user may send messages to all connected
  clients by typing a CR/LF-terminated string to standard input.  To send the
  message "Chatting is fun" to all currently-connected clients:
    Chatting is fun<CR/LF>

  It is possible to send a message to a specific peer (private chat) by 
  starting the message with @username.  To send the message "I like ponies" 
  only to username "bar":
    @bar I like ponies<CR/LF>

  The user may exit the chat client by typing the word "quit" alone on a line:
    quit<CR/LF>
