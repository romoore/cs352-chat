Compiling the client:
  The chat client has been written according to Java 1.6.  If you do not have
  Java 1.6 installed, please download and install the JDK from Oracle at
  <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html>.

  To compile the chat client, include the "src/main/java" directory in the 
  class path and provide edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient as the main class to 
  be compiled:

    javac -cp src/main/java/ src/main/java/edu/rutgers/cs/chat/ChatClient.java

Running the client:
  The chat client requires 2 command-line parameters: local listen port and 
  username.  These are the first two parameters to the client.  Optionally,
  multiple remote clients may be specified as bootstrap clients.  Each pair of
  additional parameters are the remote host/IP address and port number.

  To start the client with "foo" as the username, listening on port 12345:
    java -cp src/main/java/ edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient 12345 foo

  To start the client with "foo" as the username, 12345 as the listen port,
  and 1.2.3.4:9999 as a bootstrap peer:
    java -cp src/main/java/ edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient 12345 foo 1.2.3.4 9999
  
  To start the client with "foo" as the username, 12345 as the listen port,
  a GUI, and 1.2.3.4:9999 as a bootstrap peer:
    java -cp src/main/java/ edu.rutgers.cs.chat.ChatClient 12345 foo 1.2.3.4 \
      9999 --gui

Interacting with the console-based user interface:
  The current version uses a console user interface by default. Once connected
  to a remote peer, the user may send messages to all connected clients by
  typing a CR/LF-terminated string to standard input.  To send the message
  "Chatting is fun" to all currently-connected clients:
    Chatting is fun<CR/LF>

  It is possible to send a message to a specific peer (private chat) by 
  starting the message with @username.  To send the message "I like ponies" 
  only to username "bar":
    @bar I like ponies<CR/LF>

  The user may exit the chat client by typing the word "quit" alone on a line:
    quit<CR/LF>

Interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI):
  You can use the GUI by passing --gui as a command-line option at startup.
  The GUI has several components: the User List shows all connected users,
  the Chat Log shows the chat history, You Message is a buffer where you can
  input your next message.  
  
  To send your message to all users, type it into the Your Message buffer, and
  click "Send" or press "Enter".  If you wish to input a newline character in
  your buffer, use Shift+Enter.  If you want to send a private message to
  another user, select their name in the User List and then click Send or
  press Enter after typing your message in the buffer.  You must reselect a
  user name to send another private message.
